# WheelsOnRent
A website to provide vehicles on rent to tourists,

## Motivation
There is a rare availability of renting vehicles in some tourist places for only a specific period of time so here we try and do the same by giving the vehicles in for the specific period of time they want (includes hourly basis also).

## Technologies used
It has technologies like bootstrap, html, css in the frontend part of the website 
and it has php at the backend part of the website..

## Features
The extra features that we have included in our projects based on our research are 24 hour availability, all types of vehicles (on demand basis), can extend vehicle period (informing before 1 hr).

## Installation
You need to install xampp server to make this project work dynamically(login and signup page, customer feedback page).
